This is one of my first nerual network projects. You train it with text either from a URL or a file.
You need to restart it after generating a model and then load it, give it a few parameters and boom, it starts writing!
There are a few constants in the main.py program you can change depending on the type of text you feed it.
The current settings shouldent take too long to train and get some decent results, have fun!
